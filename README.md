AquaShield - your reliable partner in home safety and water management.
AquaShield is an innovative IoT solution designed to protect your home from water leaks and sudden water flow. By analyzing flow patterns, AquaShield offers real-time monitoring and instant notifications, ensuring you stay informed and in control. In Sri Lanka, where the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) provides only one-time consideration for sudden water flow, AquaShield helps you prevent costly bills by addressing leaks promptly.
